When developing applications that handle many different users we want to avoid as much as possible blocking I/O operations. Blocking I/O operations are ones in which the thread is effectively held up whilst waiting for the I/O operation to complete. This means that with a particularly time consuming operation it is impossible for the thread to be executing any other tasks. When trying to build applications that deal with multiple users doing lots of different requests, blocking I/O operations can make the application far less performant.
