        End of passion play, crumbling away I’m your source of self-destruction
        Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear Leading on your death’s
        construction Taste me you will see More is all you need Dedicated to How
        I’m killing you Come crawling faster Obey your master Your life burns
        faster Obey your master Master Master of puppets, I’m pulling your
        strings Twisting your mind, smashing your dreams Blinded by me, you
        can’t see a thing Just call my name ’cause I’ll hear you scream "Master,
        master" Just call my name ’cause I’ll hear you scream "Master, master"
      </p>
      <p>
        Say your prayers, little one Don't forget, my son To include everyone
        Tuck you in, warm within Keep you free from sin 'Til the sandman, he
        comes Sleep with one eye open Gripping your pillow tight Exit light
        Enter night Take my hand We're off to never-never land Somethings wrong,
        shut the light Heavy thoughts tonight And they aren't of Snow White
        Dreams of war, dreams of liars Dreams of dragon's fire And of things
        that will bite, yeah
