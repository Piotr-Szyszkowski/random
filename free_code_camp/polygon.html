    <p>
      End of passion play, crumbling away I’m your source of self-destruction
      Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear Leading on your death’s
      construction Taste me you will see More is all you need Dedicated to How
      I’m killing you Come crawling faster Obey your master Your life burns
      faster Obey your master Master Master of puppets, I’m pulling your strings
      Twisting your mind, smashing your dreams Blinded by me, you can’t see a
      thing Just call my name ’cause I’ll hear you scream "Master, master" Just
      call my name ’cause I’ll hear you scream "Master, master"
